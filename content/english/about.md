# About

My first real contact with programming was during a mechatronics technical course I took in high school, when I was still figuring out where my life was heading. Among all the disciplines, the automation classes stood out—solving problems using simple C programs compiled into microcontrollers made my eyes shine.

Before that, during middle school, I had some exposure to HTML and CSS through small computer courses that were common back in the day, where I built simple webpages.

In 2016, the year after finishing high school, I enrolled at Mogi das Cruzes University to study Information Systems.

I started my career as a Software Developer in 2018, after serving for a year in the Brazilian army. Since then, I've worked on projects ranging from startups to large companies.

Along this path, I developed a passion for using technology to solve problems. I build solutions from scratch and maintain existing ones. I started as a back-end focused developer, but now I work across many aspects of a software system — databases, APIs, user interfaces, deployment, and more. With each problem I solve, I deepen my knowledge in one area or many.
