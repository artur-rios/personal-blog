# Hello World

Greetings to everyone reading this. This is the very first post of this blog, and I'll start by explaining why I decided to start one and what I want to share here.

The main reason is actually very simple: I like to write. That doesn't mean I'm a professional writer or anything close to it. I don't earn any money writing outside my job as a software developer. I don't have any published papers (yet), since I didn't follow the academic path back in college. But writing has always been a sort of escape for me. Growing up, I was a very shy person from the early days of elementary school through high school. I used to write my feelings in a notebook and keep them there. Of course, I grew up and became more open to dialogue — communication is a very important skill, and I had to develop it anyway. Now that I work as a developer, part of my job includes writing things besides code, like documentation that's not only technical but also business-related. In short, writing is something I enjoy and a skill worth developing. Creating a blog to post some of my texts is motivation, and perhaps someone will find something interesting or useful. If you've already taken some time to read about who I am, you know by now that I'm Brazilian, so English is not my native language. Writing here is a way of practicing it too. If you ever find a grammatical error, or if the text feels somehow off, feel free to let me know so I can improve. I'll try to publish everything here in both English and Portuguese, so I can practice the language I've been learning and my mother tongue as well.

I have no intention of making money with this, nor am I concerned about how many people access the blog. This is something I'm doing for myself. Maybe it will grow into something bigger, but that's not the intention right now. I'll just use this space to share some ideas, some technical articles, and anything else I find worth writing about.

I don't want to use social networks to post my texts, because I'm trying to escape their logic and want to have as much control over my content as possible.

That's it for now — a slow start, I think. Let's see how it goes. See you in the next post!
