# About

My first contact with programming was during a mechatronics technical course I took during high school when I was still figuring out where I was going with my life. Among all the other disciplines of the course, the automation classes that involved among other things, solving problems using simple software written in C and compiled into microcontrollers, made my eyes shine.

Before, during middle school, I had some contact with HTML and CSS on small informatic courses that were common back in the day, and had already developed simple webpages.

I enrolled in the Mogi das Cruzes University in 2016, the year after I finished high school, to study Systems of Information.

Started my career as a Software Developer in 2018, after serving for a year in the Brazilian army. Since then, I have worked on different projects from startups to big companies.

Through this path, I developed a passion for using technology to solve problems. I work on creating solutions from scratch or maintaining existing ones. I started as a back-end focused developer, but by now I can work on many different aspects of a software system. Databases, APIs, User Interfaces, deployment, etc. With each problem I solve, I improve my knowledge in one or many areas.
